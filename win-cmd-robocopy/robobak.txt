Usage
>robobak.bat [full|diff] [debug|nodebug] [targetpath] [sourcepath] [backupname - optional or !]

[full|diff]       full creates a full backup, diff creates a differential backup using the archive bit which will be deleted after copy
[debug|nodebug]   debug will run robocopy with option /L, also no folders will be created, a logfile is written to the target folder
[targetpath]      backups will go into targetpath, a folder and a logfile will be created in targetpath - do not use blanks
[sourcepath]      sourcepath to the files and folders you want to have backed up - do not use blanks
[backupname]      optional - if it is set, the backup folder and logfile will start with this name, 
                  if not set or "!" is used, the last folder's name of sourcepath is used

NOTE: targetpath has to be given first, before sourcepath!
